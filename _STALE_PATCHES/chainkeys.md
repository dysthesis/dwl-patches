### Description
Implements chained keybindings (like the dwm [keychain](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/keychain/) patch).

Bindings can share a leading chain key. This chain key will be triggered when Mod+chain is pressed. A subsequent keypress will be matched against bindings for that chain key. If it is configured the action will be triggered, otherwise the keypress will be ignored.
