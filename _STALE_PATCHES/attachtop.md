### Description

This is a port of attachtop patch for dwm: https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachtop

New client attaches below the last master/on top of the stack.

Behavior feels very intuitive as it doesn't disrupt existing masters no matter the amount of them, it only pushes the clients in stack down.
