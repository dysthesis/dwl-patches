### Description
Add a tab bar or window title to the top or bottom of windows.

**This is the old version of the `tab` patch. Deprecated because the [new version](https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl-patches/raw/branch-main/patches/tab) is significantly more efficient and well-written than this, and it better adheres to the suckless philosophy.**
