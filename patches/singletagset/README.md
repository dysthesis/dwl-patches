### Description
Single set of tags shared between multiple monitors.

This patch allows all the tags to be shared between both (or more) monitors.
So a single set of tags from 1 to 9 can be viewed on any monitor, as opposed to
having separate tag sets 1 to 9 on each monitor.

Originally based on the dwm single_tagset patch:
