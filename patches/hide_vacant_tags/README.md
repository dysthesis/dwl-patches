### Description

Prevent [bar](https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl-patches/wiki/bar) from drawing tags with no clients (i.e. vacant).
It also stops drawing empty rectangles on the bar for non-vacant tags as there is no need anymore to distinguish vacant tags and it offers a more visible contrast than if there were filled/empty rectangles.
