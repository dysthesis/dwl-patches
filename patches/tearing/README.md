### Description
This patch adds support for tearing protocol. To get it working `export WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1` is probably required.
Setting `ForceTearingRule` is also probably required since surfaces always receive presentation hint 0 (VSYNC) as far as i can tell.

Set rules in the config.h (exact string match):
```
static const ForceTearingRule force_tearing[] = {
	{.title = "", .appid = "oni.exe"},
	{.title = "", .appid = "hl_linux"},
	{.title = "", .appid = "steam_app_210970"},
};

```
