### Description

This patch adds `menu` command, which allows dwl to interface with dmenu-like programs.

By default, two menus are available:
- focusing a window by its title by pressing `Alt+o`
- selecting a layout from a list by pressing `Alt+Shift+o`

Edit `menus` array in `config.h` to add/change menus and use a different dmenu program.
