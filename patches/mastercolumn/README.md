### Description
This patch adds an extra layout to dwl called `mastercol` in which the windows in the master area are arranged in columns of equal size. The number of columns is always nmaster + 1, and the last column is a stack of leftover windows just like the normal tile layout. It effectively acts like the default tiling mode, except provides for vertical instead of horizontal master windows.
